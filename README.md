* This project is closed for more than a decade and receives no support.
* For historical and didactic reasons we decided to share it with the world.
* This code is closed and will not accept any contribution.
* Please DO NOT bifurquen this code (DO NOT FORK PLEASE).
* These modules were written in 1994 and at that time many trade mark WERE NOT for that reason we add scripts to name the year accompanied TO AVOID ANY CONFUSION.
* We used a Novell Netware 4.x as data server for drive letter "F:".
* All comments are written in Castilian language and there is a LEEME.md file with translation into that language.
